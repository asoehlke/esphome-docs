    :description: Instructions for setting up cd74hc4067 Analog Multiplexer and sensors.
    :image: cd74hc4067.jpg


The ``cd74hc4067`` Analog Multiplexer component allows you to attach up to 16 analog input sensors to a single ADC pin.
The component is used to activate the right multiplexer pin for each of the defined cd74hc4067 sensors.
Since the cd74hc4067 sensors are also voltage sensors, they can be used as input for :doc:`CT clamp sensors <ct_clamp>`, 
as in the configuration example below.

For further information about the cd74hc4067 chip see the `spec sheet  <https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd74hc4067.pdf>`__
and there are also some guides around like the one from `Adam Meyer <http://adam-meyer.com/arduino/CD74HC4067>`__.

Actually, the chip is bidirectional and could also be used as output, but this is not supported by the component yet.

First, you need to configure the component with the digital pins that control the multiplexer. 
Then you need to set up a voltage sensor source (e.g. :doc:`ADC sensor <adc>`) and pass it to the cd74hc4067 sensors with the ``sensor`` option.
Each cd74hc4067 sensor is configured for one of the 16 input pins of the multiplexer.

In the example below, the ``adc`` and ``cd74hc4067`` sensors are internal and :doc:`CT clamp sensors <ct_clamp>` used on each of the sensors.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

cd74hc4067 component
********************

- **pin_s0** to **pin_s3** (**Required**, :ref:`config-pin`): The I/O pins connected to the S0 to S3 channel selection pins
- **delay** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-time`): A small delay duration needed for the chip to switch inputs, defaults to 2ms.
- All other options from Component.

cd74hc4067 sensor
********************

- **sensor** (**Required**, :ref:`config-id`): The source sensor to measure voltage values from, e.g. :doc:`ADC sensor <adc>`.
- **number** (*Required*, :ref:`config-number`): The number of the cd74hc4067 input pin (0-15)
- All other options from :ref:`Sensor <config-sensor>`.
